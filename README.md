Data analysis of warehouse inventory using Kaggle’s Inventory Analysis dataset

## Goal:
Conduct an inventory analysis to identify areas for improvement and optimize inventory management practices

## Background 
The company operates a chain of retail stores selling alcohol products such as wine, vodka, and whiskey. Inventory is purchased directly from a range of vendors and distributed across multiple store locations. With a wide assortment of products and varying vendor lead times, the company faces challenges in maintaining optimal inventory levels—leading to occasional stockouts, overstocked items, and inefficient purchasing practices.

To address these issues, this project utilizes the Inventory Analysis dataset from Kaggle to analyze purchasing patterns, inventory turnover, vendor performance, and sales trends. The insights gained will be used to develop a data-driven inventory management strategy tailored for a retail operation handling finished goods.

## Objectives:
The primary objectives of this finished goods inventory analysis are:

1. Determine optimal inventory levels for finished products across stores
2. Identify and reduce stockouts and excess inventory to improve service levels and reduce costs
3. Analyze inventory turnover and carrying costs to optimize working capital
4. Streamline the purchasing and replenishment processes to improve operational efficiency
5. Develop a sustainable inventory management strategy for future scalability

## Tasks
To meet these objectives, the following tasks will be performed:

1. Inventory Turnover Analysis
- Measure how efficiently products are being sold and replenished
- Highlight slow- and fast-moving SKUs

2) ABC Analysis
- Classify SKUs based on revenue contribution
- Focus management attention on high-impact items

3) Reorder Point (ROP) Analysis
- Estimate reorder points based on sales velocity and lead times
- Prevent stockouts by setting proper thresholds

4) Lead Time Analysis
- Evaluate delivery timing consistency for each vendor
- Identify vendors causing frequent delays

5) Carrying Cost Analysis
- Calculate storage and holding costs based on average inventory levels
- Identify areas for cost reduction

6) Vendor Performance Analysis
- Compare vendors by spend, SKU variety, delivery frequency, and reliability
- Recommend high-value, consistent suppliers

7) Process Improvement
- Analyze purchasing and replenishment workflows
- Suggest improvements for smoother store operations

8) Demand Forecasting
- Forecast future demand using historical sales
- Support better ordering and inventory planning decisions


## Deliverables
Based on the analysis of sales, inventory, purchasing, and vendor performance, the following deliverables will be provided:

1) Optimal Inventory Levels
Recommendations for maintaining appropriate inventory levels of finished goods across all store locations to reduce both stockouts and overstocking.

2) Reorder Point Calculations
Calculated reorder points for key products based on sales velocity and lead times to improve inventory availability and prevent missed sales.

3) Vendor Performance Insights
Comparative analysis of vendor reliability, SKU diversity, and purchasing frequency to inform better supplier management decisions.

4) Inventory Turnover & Carrying Cost Analysis
Evaluation of inventory turnover ratios and holding costs to identify slow-moving products and reduce inventory-related expenses.

5) Process Improvement Recommendations
Suggestions for optimizing purchasing and replenishment workflows, particularly around shared purchase orders and inter-store coordination.

6) Inventory Management Strategy
A sustainable inventory management approach tailored for multi-store retail operations, designed to enhance operational efficiency and support future scalability.

By conducting this inventory optimization project, the retail company aims to reduce inventory costs, improve product availability, strengthen vendor relationships, and enhance overall operational efficiency across its store network.
